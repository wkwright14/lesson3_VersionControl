## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control allows developers to keep track of multiple versions and configurations within a software system. A version control system allows the user to see what changes were made to a file, what differences there are now, when the changes were made, who made the changes and also merge the changes.
2. Git is a distributed open source version control system, which means that every user also has a local repository on their own machine and can work offline, there are no distinct points of failure, the processes run quickly, and files cannot be overwritten on a shared repository.
3. Git uses only local files, so nothing is needed from other computers in a userâ€™s network, which means that it is very quick. This is possible because everything that was ever done to the project is on the local disk rather than pulling from other places. It also means that even changes made months ago can be pulled quickly and locally rather than going through a middle man. All work can be done on the local copy and then later uploaded when a user has internet access.
